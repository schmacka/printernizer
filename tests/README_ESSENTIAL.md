# Essential Tests for Printernizer Milestone 1.1

This directory contains a **limited set of essential tests** focused on core functionality validation without over-testing.

## Test Philosophy

Following the user's request for "limited set of tests" and "don't create too many tests", this test suite covers only the most critical functionality:

- **Quality over quantity** - Each test validates essential business logic
- **Core functionality focus** - Tests critical paths and German business requirements
- **Minimal but effective** - Avoids redundant or excessive test coverage

## Essential Test Files

### Backend Tests (Python/pytest)

1. **`test_essential_models.py`** - Data model validation
   - Printer, Job, and File model creation and validation
   - German business fields (material costs, VAT, customer classification)
   - Enum validation and JSON serialization

2. **`test_essential_config.py`** - German business configuration
   - German timezone (Europe/Berlin) 
   - EUR currency formatting and VAT calculations
   - Business vs private job classification
   - File naming with German characters (umlauts)

3. **`test_essential_integration.py`** - Core workflow integration
   - Complete printer setup workflow
   - Health check system validation
   - German business logic integration
   - Error handling across the system

4. **`backend/test_api_health.py`** - Essential API endpoint
   - Health check endpoint (critical for monitoring)
   - Response format validation
   - German timezone verification
   - Performance validation (< 1 second)

### Frontend Tests (JavaScript/Jest)

5. **`frontend/test_essential_forms.js`** - Form validation
   - Printer configuration form validation
   - German character support in forms
   - API error handling with German messages
   - File management form states
   - Accessibility validation

## Key Testing Areas

### ✅ Covered (Essential Only)
- **Data Models**: Core validation and German business fields
- **Configuration**: German timezone, currency, VAT, business rules
- **API Health**: System monitoring endpoint
- **Integration**: Core printer setup workflow
- **Frontend Forms**: Essential form validation with German support
- **Error Handling**: German error messages and validation

### ❌ Intentionally NOT Covered (Avoiding Over-Testing)
- Extensive API endpoint testing (comprehensive tests already exist)
- Performance stress testing 
- Complex WebSocket testing
- Hardware integration tests
- Detailed printer driver testing
- Exhaustive error scenario coverage

## Running the Tests

### Quick Essential Test Run
```bash
# Run essential tests only
python tests/run_essential_tests.py

# With verbose output
python tests/run_essential_tests.py --verbose

# With coverage report
python tests/run_essential_tests.py --coverage
```

### Manual Test Execution
```bash
# Backend tests only
pytest tests/test_essential_models.py -v
pytest tests/test_essential_config.py -v  
pytest tests/test_essential_integration.py -v
pytest tests/backend/test_api_health.py -v

# Frontend tests (if Node.js/Jest available)
npx jest tests/frontend/test_essential_forms.js --verbose
```

## Test Requirements

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Frontend Dependencies (Optional)
```bash
npm install -g jest jsdom
```

## German Business Validation

These tests specifically validate German market requirements for Porcus3D:

- **Timezone**: Europe/Berlin for all timestamps
- **Currency**: EUR formatting with German locale  
- **VAT**: 19% German business tax rate
- **Business Classification**: GmbH, AG, UG detection
- **File Naming**: Support for German umlauts (äöüÄÖÜß)
- **Error Messages**: German language validation errors

## Success Criteria

✅ **All tests pass** = Milestone 1.1 core functionality is validated

The essential test suite validates:
1. Data models work correctly with German business data
2. System configuration supports German business requirements  
3. Core API endpoints respond properly
4. Frontend forms validate German input correctly
5. Integration workflow functions end-to-end
