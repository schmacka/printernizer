# Library System - Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Branch**: `feature/library-system`
**Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETE - Ready for testing & Phase 2
**Version**: v1.2.0-alpha

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive **Library System** for Printernizer that provides unified file management across all sources (printers and watch folders). The system uses content-based file identification (SHA-256 checksums) for automatic deduplication and intelligent organization.

### Key Achievements

✅ **Automatic File Organization**: All files from watch folders and printer downloads automatically added to library
✅ **Content-Based Deduplication**: Same file from multiple sources = one library entry
✅ **Multi-Source Tracking**: Track where each file came from
✅ **REST API**: 6 endpoints for complete library access
✅ **Scalable Storage**: Sharded directory structure for 1000+ files
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Old file APIs continue working

---

## What We Built

### 1. Database Layer

**Migration**: `007_library_system.sql`

**Tables Created**:
- `library_files` - Main file storage (checksum as unique key)
- `library_file_sources` - Track multiple sources per file
- `collections` - File collections/groups (future use)
- `collection_members` - Many-to-many for collections

**Performance**:
- 15+ indexes for fast queries
- 2 materialized views for statistics
- Optimized for pagination and filtering

### 2. Core Service

**File**: `src/services/library_service.py` (540 lines)

**Capabilities**:
- SHA-256 checksum calculation (async, chunked, non-blocking)
- Intelligent file organization:
  - Watch folders: `library/models/{shard}/{checksum}.ext`
  - Printers: `library/printers/{printer_name}/{shard}/{checksum}_filename`
- Disk space validation (requires 1.5x file size)
- Race condition handling (concurrent additions)
- Automatic deduplication
- Metadata extraction coordination

**Storage Structure**:
```
library/
├── models/              # Watch folder files
│   └── a3/              # Sharded by checksum
│       └── a3f8d...29e.3mf
├── printers/
│   ├── bambu_a1/
│   │   └── a3/
│   │       └── a3f8d...29e_benchy.gcode
│   └── prusa_core_one/
│       └── ...
└── .metadata/
    ├── thumbnails/
    └── previews/
```

### 3. REST API

**File**: `src/api/routers/library.py` (420 lines)

**Endpoints**:

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/library/files` | List with filters & pagination |
| GET | `/api/v1/library/files/{checksum}` | Get file details |
| POST | `/api/v1/library/files/{checksum}/reprocess` | Reprocess metadata |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/library/files/{checksum}` | Delete file |
| GET | `/api/v1/library/statistics` | Library stats |
| GET | `/api/v1/library/health` | Health check |

**Features**:
- Pydantic models for validation
- Comprehensive error handling (404, 500)
- OpenAPI documentation
- Pagination (default 50, max 200)
- Multiple filters (source, type, status, search, thumbnail, metadata)

### 4. Integration Layer

**Watch Folders → Library**:
- Modified `FileWatcherService` to auto-add files
- Files copied to library (preserves originals)
- Source: `{type: 'watch_folder', folder_path, relative_path}`

**Printer Downloads → Library**:
- Modified `FileService` to auto-add after download
- Files copied to library (preserves downloads folder)
- Source: `{type: 'printer', printer_id, printer_name, original_filename}`

**Service Dependencies**:
```
LibraryService (initialized first)
    ↓
FileWatcherService (uses library)
    ↓
FileService (uses library)
```

## Technical Highlights

### Content-Based Identity

**Problem**: Filename-based IDs cause duplicates
**Solution**: SHA-256 checksum as primary key

```python
# Same file from watch folder and printer = one entry
watch_folder_file = "benchy.3mf" → checksum: a3f8d...29e
printer_file = "benchy.gcode"    → checksum: a3f8d...29e
# Result: Single library entry with 2 sources
```

### Sharding for Scalability

**Problem**: 10,000 files in one folder = slow filesystem
**Solution**: Use first 2 chars of checksum for sharding

```
library/printers/bambu_a1/
├── a3/  (256 files max)
├── b7/  (256 files max)
└── ... (256 shards = 65,536 files before slowdown)
```

### Disk Space Protection

**Problem**: Library could fill disk
**Solution**: Check before copying

```python
required_space = file_size * 1.5  # 50% safety buffer
if disk_free < required_space:
    raise IOError("Insufficient disk space")
```

### Race Condition Handling

**Problem**: Concurrent downloads of same file
**Solution**: Database UNIQUE constraint + cleanup

```python
try:
    await database.create_library_file(record)
except IntegrityError:  # Checksum already exists
    # Another process added it - just add our source
    await library_service.add_file_source(checksum, source_info)
```

## File Flow Examples

### Watch Folder File Discovered

```
1. User adds file to /models/benchy.3mf
2. FileWatcherService detects file
3. Calculate checksum: a3f8d...29e
4. Check library: File doesn't exist
5. Copy to library/models/a3/{checksum}.3mf
6. Create database record with source
7. Schedule metadata extraction
8. File discoverable via API
```

### Printer File Downloaded

```
1. User clicks download on printer file
2. FileService downloads to downloads/bambu_a1/benchy.gcode
3. Calculate checksum: a3f8d...29e
4. Check library: File already exists (same as watch folder!)
5. Add printer source to existing record
6. File now has 2 sources (watch_folder + printer)
7. Accessible via unified API
```

### Duplicate File Handling

```
File discovered with checksum that exists:
1. Don't copy file again
2. Add new source to sources array
3. Update last_accessed timestamp
4. Return existing record
Result: One file, multiple sources tracked
```

## Testing Status

### What's Been Tested

- ✅ Code review completed
- ✅ Architecture validation
- ✅ Error handling review
- ✅ Security review

### Pending Testing

- ⏳ Unit tests (LibraryService methods)
- ⏳ Integration tests (end-to-end flows)
- ⏳ Performance tests (1000+ files)
- ⏳ Manual testing with real files
- ⏳ Deduplication verification
- ⏳ Multi-source tracking verification

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No UI Yet**: Library only accessible via API (Phase 2 will add UI)
2. **No Tests**: Code coverage is 0% (will be addressed)
3. **No File Versioning**: File modifications create new entries (future feature)
4. **Basic Search**: Only filename search implemented (full-text in Phase 3)
5. **No Bulk Operations**: Must process files individually (Phase 3)

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Old APIs Still Work

- ✅ `/api/v1/files` - Old files endpoint
- ✅ Downloads folder structure preserved
- ✅ Watch folder file tracking
- ✅ Existing database tables unchanged

### Graceful Degradation

- With `LIBRARY_ENABLED=false`:
  - Library service initialized but inactive
  - File watcher continues normally
  - Downloads work as before
  - No library operations performed

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented

- ✅ Checksum verification after copy/move
- ✅ Path validation (no traversal attacks)
- ✅ Write permission checks
- ✅ Disk space limits
- ✅ Proper error handling (no info leakage)

### Future Enhancements

- File extension whitelist (prevent .exe, .sh)
- Virus scanning integration
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Per-user file quotas

---
