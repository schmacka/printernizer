╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

QUICK START - Run this command to complete the restoration:

    git push origin development


WHAT HAPPENED:
--------------
The development branch was accidentally deleted from GitHub. I analyzed
the git history and successfully recovered it from commit 09fa532, which
was the last commit before it was merged to master via PR #237.


CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
✅ Development branch recreated locally at commit: 09fa532
✅ All commit history preserved
✅ Two-branch model restored (development + master)
⏳ PENDING: Push to GitHub (requires your authentication)


TO COMPLETE THE RESTORATION:
-----------------------------
Simply run ONE of these commands:

  1. Standard push (recommended):
     $ git push origin development

  2. With tracking branch:
     $ git push -u origin development

  3. Force push (only if standard push fails):
     $ git push --force origin development


VERIFICATION:
-------------
After pushing, verify the branch exists on GitHub:

  $ git ls-remote --heads origin | grep development

You should see:
  [commit-sha]  refs/heads/development
