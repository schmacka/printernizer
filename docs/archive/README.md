## Why Archive?

Documentation is archived when:
1. **Feature is complete and released** - Implementation docs after feature ships
2. **Milestone reached** - Planning docs after milestone completion
3. **Issue resolved** - Bug fix documentation after fix is deployed
4. **Superseded by new docs** - Older docs replaced by updated versions
