## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### 1. **No Authentication System** - CRITICAL SECURITY RISK
- **Impact**: Complete API exposure to unauthorized access
- **Location**: All API endpoints (`src/main.py`)
- **Risk**: Unauthorized printer control, data theft
- **Fix**: Implement JWT or API key authentication system
- **Priority**: P0 - Immediate

### 2. **Plain Text Credential Storage** - CRITICAL SECURITY RISK  
- **Impact**: Printer credentials exposed in config files
- **Location**: `config/printers.json` (lines 10, 18, 28)
- **Risk**: Printer compromise and unauthorized access
- **Fix**: Implement credential encryption using Fernet or similar
- **Priority**: P0 - Immediate

### 3. **Database Transaction Management** - CRITICAL CODE ISSUE
- **Impact**: Potential data corruption and connection leaks
- **Location**: `src/services/printer_service.py` (lines 88-106)
- **Risk**: Database integrity issues under load
- **Fix**: Use proper transaction context managers
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  # Current (problematic):
  async with self.database._connection.cursor() as cursor:
      # ... operations
      await self.database._connection.commit()
  
  # Fix:
  async with self.database.transaction() as conn:
      async with conn.cursor() as cursor:
          # ... operations (auto-commit)
  ```
- **Priority**: P0 - Immediate

### 4. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities** - HIGH SECURITY RISK
- **Impact**: Database compromise potential
- **Location**: `src/database/database.py` (lines 284-288, 365-368)
- **Risk**: Data exfiltration and manipulation
- **Fix**: Use parameterized queries exclusively
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  # Current (vulnerable):
  query = f"UPDATE jobs SET {', '.join(set_clauses)} WHERE id = ?"
  
  # Fix:
  allowed_fields = {'status', 'progress', 'material_used'}
  set_clauses = [f"{field} = ?" for field in updates.keys() if field in allowed_fields]
  ```
- **Priority**: P0 - Immediate
