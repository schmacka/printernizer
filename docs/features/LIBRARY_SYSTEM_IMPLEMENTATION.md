## Technical Architecture

### Content-Addressable Storage

**Checksum Algorithm:** SHA-256
**Sharding:** First 2 hex characters (256 buckets)
**Deduplication:** Automatic based on content hash

**Directory Structure:**
```
library/
├── printers/
│   ├── {printer_name}/
│   │   ├── {shard}/
│   │   │   └── {checksum}.{ext}
├── models/
│   ├── {shard}/
│   │   └── {checksum}.{ext}
└── uploads/
    ├── {shard}/
    │   └── {checksum}.{ext}
```

### Multi-Source Tracking

Each physical file can have multiple sources (junction table):
- Source type (printer/watch_folder/upload)
- Printer ID and name
- Folder path and relative path
- Discovery timestamp

### Database Design

**Primary Table:** `library_files`
- Stores file once by checksum
- 50+ metadata columns
- JSON sources array (denormalized for quick access)

**Junction Table:** `library_file_sources`
- Links checksum to multiple sources
- Enables source-specific queries
- Tracks discovery and import metadata

**Collections:** `collections` and `collection_members`
- User-defined groupings
- Many-to-many relationship

### API Design

**RESTful Endpoints:**
- Pagination with `page` and `limit` parameters
- Filtering with query parameters
- Pydantic validation for all inputs/outputs
- Consistent error responses
- Stream responses for large files

### Frontend Architecture

**Component-Based Design:**
- `LibraryManager` class encapsulates all functionality
- Separation of concerns (rendering, API calls, state)
- Event-driven updates via WebSocket
- Responsive design with CSS Grid

**State Management:**
- Filters stored in manager instance
- Current page and page size tracking
- Selected file for detail view
- Loading states for async operations
