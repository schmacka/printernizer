# Library System - Quick Start Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-03

## Overview

The Library System is a unified file management solution that replaces the traditional "Files" section with a content-addressable storage system featuring deduplication, multi-source tracking, and comprehensive metadata management.

---

## Key Concepts

### Content-Addressable Storage
- Files are uniquely identified by **SHA-256 checksum** (not filename)
- Same file from different sources = one physical copy
- Automatic deduplication saves disk space

### Multi-Source Tracking
- One file can come from multiple sources:
  - **Printers** (Bambu Lab, Prusa)
  - **Watch Folders** (monitored directories)
  - **Uploads** (manual uploads)
- All sources are tracked and displayed

### Sharded Storage
- Files organized in 256 buckets (by first 2 hex digits of checksum)
- Prevents filesystem performance issues with 10,000+ files
- Example: `library/printers/A1/3f/3f2a9b... .3mf`

---

## Using the Library

### Accessing the Library

1. Click **"üóÑÔ∏è Bibliothek"** in the main navigation
2. The Library page displays:
   - **Statistics cards** (total files, size, thumbnails, analyzed)
   - **Filter bar** (source type, file type, status, metadata, sort)
   - **Files grid** with thumbnails and metadata
   - **Pagination** controls

### Viewing Files

**File Cards Show:**
- Thumbnail (or file type icon)
- Status badge (Available/Downloaded/Local/Error)
- Filename
- Source icon (üñ®Ô∏è Printer / üìÅ Watch Folder / ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload)
- File size
- Print time (if available)
- Quick metadata (layer height, temperature, filament)

**Click a file card** to open the detail modal with 3 tabs:
1. **√úbersicht (Overview)** - Print settings, materials, model properties
2. **Metadaten (Metadata)** - All extracted metadata fields
3. **Quellen (Sources)** - All sources where this file came from

### Filtering Files

**Available Filters:**
- **Source Type:** All / Printer / Watch Folder / Upload
- **File Type:** All / 3MF / G-code / STL / OBJ
- **Status:** All / Available / Downloaded / Local / Error
- **Metadata:** All / With Thumbnails / Analyzed
- **Sort By:** Date / Name / Size / Print Time (ascending/descending)

**Search:** Type in the search box (300ms debounce)

### File Actions

From the **file detail modal**, you can:

1. **üîÑ Neu analysieren (Reprocess)**
   - Re-extracts metadata from the file
   - Useful if metadata extraction was previously failed

2. **‚¨áÔ∏è Herunterladen (Download)**
   - Downloads the file to your computer
   - Opens in new tab/downloads directly

3. **üóëÔ∏è L√∂schen (Delete)**
   - Removes file from library
   - Deletes physical file and all database entries
   - Confirmation dialog shown

## Automatic File Management

### Files from Printers

When you download a file from a printer (Bambu Lab or Prusa):
1. File is downloaded to `/app/data/downloads/` (temporary)
2. Checksum is calculated
3. If duplicate found, source is added (no duplicate copy)
4. If new, file is copied to `library/printers/{printer_name}/{shard}/`
5. Metadata is automatically extracted
6. File appears in Library immediately

### Files from Watch Folders

When a file is discovered in a watch folder:
1. File is detected by the FileWatcherService
2. Checksum is calculated
3. If duplicate found, source is added
4. If new, file is copied to `library/models/{shard}/`
5. Metadata is extracted
6. File appears in Library immediately

**Note:** Original files in watch folders are **not deleted**, they're copied to the library.

## Directory Structure

```
/app/data/library/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ printers/               # Files from printers
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ A1/                 # Printer name
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3f/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3f2a9b12...abc.3mf
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ff/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Prusa_Core_One/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (same structure)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/                 # Files from watch folders
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uploads/                # Files from manual uploads
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 00/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Sharding:** First 2 hex characters of checksum = subdirectory
- Example checksum: `3f2a9b12...`
- Shard: `3f`
- Path: `library/printers/A1/3f/3f2a9b12...abc.3mf`

---

## Real-Time Updates

The Library page receives real-time updates via WebSocket:
- **library_file_added** - New file added
- **library_file_updated** - File metadata updated
- **library_file_deleted** - File removed

**Behavior:**
- Statistics update immediately
- File grid refreshes if on page 1
- Current filters/search are preserved

---

## Deduplication Example

**Scenario:** Same 3MF file on printer and in watch folder

1. **File discovered on Printer A1**
   - Checksum: `3f2a9b12...`
   - Copied to: `library/printers/A1/3f/3f2a9b12...abc.3mf`
   - Database entry created
   - Source added: `{type: "printer", printer_name: "A1"}`

2. **Same file found in watch folder `/models/projects/`**
   - Checksum calculated: `3f2a9b12...` (match!)
   - Physical file **not copied** (already exists)
   - Source added: `{type: "watch_folder", folder_path: "/models/projects/"}`
   - Database entry updated with new source

3. **In Library UI**
   - **One file card** displayed
   - Sources tab shows **both sources**:
     - üñ®Ô∏è Printer A1
     - üìÅ /models/projects/

**Result:** One physical file, one database entry, two tracked sources.

## Troubleshooting

### File not appearing in Library

**Check:**
1. Is `LIBRARY_ENABLED=true` in config?
2. Was file successfully downloaded/discovered?
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Verify disk space (must have `LIBRARY_MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB` free)
5. Check file permissions on library directory

### Duplicate files showing

**Possible causes:**
1. Files have different content (checksums differ)
2. Deduplication disabled (`LIBRARY_DEDUP_ENABLED=false`)
3. Files added before Library system was enabled

### Metadata not extracted

**Actions:**
1. Click **üîÑ Neu analysieren** to retry
2. Check if file type is supported (3MF, G-code)
3. Check backend logs for parser errors
4. Verify file is not corrupted

### Slow performance with many files

**Optimizations:**
1. Verify sharding is enabled (`LIBRARY_AUTO_ORGANIZE=true`)
2. Check database indexes exist (run migration)
3. Reduce page size (`limit` parameter)
4. Use filters to narrow results

---

## Migration from Old Files System

### Backward Compatibility

The old files system **continues to work** alongside the Library:
- Old "Dateien" page still accessible
- Old API endpoints still functional
- Old file downloads work

### Gradual Migration

Files are added to Library automatically:
1. **New printer downloads** - Added to Library immediately
2. **Watch folder files** - Added when discovered/rescanned
3. **Old files** - Not automatically migrated

### Manual Migration (Optional)

To migrate old files to Library:
```python
# Future feature - not yet implemented
# Will provide a migration script or UI button
```

---

## Best Practices

### Storage Management
- Monitor disk space regularly
- Enable cleanup of orphaned files
- Use collections to organize related files
- Archive old/unused files

### Performance
- Use filters instead of searching when possible
- Keep page size reasonable (50-100)
- Enable sharding for 1000+ files
- Let metadata extraction happen in background

### Organization
- Use descriptive filenames (helps search)
- Create collections for projects
- Tag files with metadata
- Review and clean up regularly
