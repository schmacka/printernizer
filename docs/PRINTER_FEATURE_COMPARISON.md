## Implementation Details

### Bambu Lab A1 Integration

**Architecture:**
- Primary: `bambulabs-api` Python library
- Fallback: Direct MQTT connection to printer
- Emergency: HTTP endpoints for basic operations

**Key Components:**
```python
class BambuLabPrinter(BasePrinter):
    """Bambu Lab printer implementation using bambulabs_api library."""
    
    # Primary connection method
    async def _connect_bambu_api(self) -> bool:
        """Connect using bambulabs_api library."""
        
    # Fallback connection method  
    async def _connect_mqtt(self) -> bool:
        """Connect using direct MQTT (fallback)."""
        
    # Camera functionality
    async def take_snapshot(self) -> Optional[bytes]:
        """Take a camera snapshot from Bambu Lab printer."""
```

**Configuration Requirements:**
- IP Address
- Access Code (8-digit)
- Serial Number
- Optional: Custom MQTT port

### Prusa Core One Integration

**Architecture:**
- HTTP REST API via PrusaLink
- Single connection method (HTTP only)

```python
class PrusaPrinter(BasePrinter):
    """Prusa Core One printer implementation using PrusaLink HTTP API."""
    
    # HTTP-based connection
    async def connect(self) -> bool:
        """Establish HTTP connection to Prusa printer."""

        """Get current printer status from Prusa."""
```

## Developer Guidelines

### Adding New Printer Support

To add support for a new printer brand, implement the `PrinterInterface`:

```python
class NewPrinter(BasePrinter):
    """New printer implementation."""
    
    # Required methods
    async def connect(self) -> bool:
    async def disconnect(self) -> None:
    async def get_status(self) -> PrinterStatusUpdate:
    async def get_job_info(self) -> Optional[JobInfo]:
    async def list_files(self) -> List[PrinterFile]:
    async def download_file(self, filename: str, local_path: str) -> bool:
    async def pause_print(self) -> bool:
    async def resume_print(self) -> bool:
    async def stop_print(self) -> bool:
    async def has_camera(self) -> bool:
    async def get_camera_stream_url(self) -> Optional[str]:
    async def take_snapshot(self) -> Optional[bytes]:
```

### Testing Printer Integration

Use the conformance tests to verify implementation:

```bash
pytest tests/test_printer_interface_conformance.py
```

### Configuration Examples

```json
{
  "id": "bambu_a1_001",
  "name": "Bambu Lab A1 #1",
  "type": "bambu_lab",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "access_code": "12345678",
  "serial_number": "AC12345678"
}
```

**Prusa Core One:**
```json
{
  "id": "prusa_core_001",
  "name": "Prusa Core One #1",
  "type": "prusa",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.101",
  "api_key": "your-api-key-here"
}
```
