# Issues to work on

[] Frontend: 
    [x] Files: Can not sort by printer. Only "Alle Drucker" is shown in the dropdown. I would expect A1BL and CoreOne to be selectable.
    [] Files: all files are displayed with "0 B" size
    [x] Files: Fehlermeldung Fehler beim Laden Entdeckte Dateien konnten nicht geladen werden.
    [] files: Layer count and other statistics of the file
    [] files: Add search bar to search for files by name
    [] files: >700 files in the statistics menu. Is that correct ?
    [] Debug page: show the information in Anwendungsprotokolle with multiple columns instead of these blocks
    [] Debug page: System-Status nicht verf√ºgbar Die Gesundheitsinformationen konnten nicht abgerufen werden.
    [] Too many notifications piling up. Not multiple of the same one at once. E.g. Only on message should appear that shows the connection status to the backend, currently we have multiple at once
    [] Is autodownload in the frontend It says ready in a notification, even when the backend is offline.
    [] Fix frontend error ::ffff:192.168.176.159 - - [01/Oct/2025 10:06:48] code 501, message Unsupported method ('POST')
::ffff:192.168.176.159 - - [01/Oct/2025 10:06:48] "POST /api/v1/errors/report HTTP/1.1" 501 -
    [] grey out printer in dashboard when connection is in progress. Show type of connection
    [] Progress bar is gone
    [] Printer tile: Layer count and other statistics of currently printed object
    [] Printer tile: Showing "Druckt" twice
