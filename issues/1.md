### Description

Integrate support for the `/planned_jobs` endpoint from the Prusa Connect API into Printernizer. This will allow users to fetch and display the printer queue directly from Prusa Connect.

### Proposed Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze API Documentation**
   - Understand authentication requirements, request parameters, response structure, and rate limits.

2. **Update the PrusaPrinter Class**
   - Add a new method `async def get_planned_jobs(self) -> List[PlannedJob]:` that interacts with the `/planned_jobs` endpoint.
   - Parse the API response and extract relevant fields such as job name, status, and estimated start time.
   - Handle error scenarios gracefully.

3. **Define Data Models**
   - Extend the `src/models/printer.py` to include a `PlannedJob` model:
     ```python
     class PlannedJob(BaseModel):
         id: str
         name: str
         status: str  # e.g., Queued, Printing, Completed
         estimated_start: Optional[datetime]
     ```

4. **Update the Printer API**
   - Add an endpoint to expose planned jobs, e.g., `/printers/{printer_id}/planned_jobs`.
   - Fetch the queue from the `get_planned_jobs` method and return it.

5. **Update the Frontend (Optional)**
   - If a frontend exists, add a component to display the printer queue.
   - Include details such as job name, status, and estimated start time.

6. **Testing**
   - **Unit Tests**: Mock API responses to test the `get_planned_jobs` method.
   - **Integration Tests**: Verify that the planned jobs endpoint works end-to-end.
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Ensure the printer queue is fetched and displayed correctly.

7. **Documentation**
   - Update the documentation to describe this feature and include usage examples.

8. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the updated codebase and verify functionality in the production environment.

### Considerations
- **Authentication**: Ensure secure handling of API keys for Prusa Connect.
- **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages if the queue cannot be fetched.
- **Performance**: Cache responses if the data is unlikely to change often.
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect the rate limits specified in the Prusa Connect API documentation.
