# Development Branch Restoration Log

**Date**: 2025-11-19
**Restored By**: GitHub Copilot (automated recovery)

## Issue
The `development` branch was accidentally deleted from the remote repository.

## Recovery Process
1. Analyzed git history using reflog and commit logs
2. Located the last commit on the development branch: `09fa532`
3. This commit was merged into master via PR #237 on Nov 18, 2025
4. Recreated the development branch from commit `09fa532`
5. Pushed the restored branch to GitHub

## Verification
- Development branch now points to: `09fa532` 
- Commit message: "Merge pull request #236 from schmacka/copilot/fix-library-repository-import-again"
- Branch follows the two-branch model documented in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Notes
- The development branch was successfully recovered with full commit history
- All work since the merge (master branch commits) remains intact
- Future feature branches should continue to target the development branch as per CONTRIBUTING.md

## References
