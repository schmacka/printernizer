### API Routing Standards

**CRITICAL: Trailing Slash Policy**

This application has `redirect_slashes=False` configured in FastAPI to prevent conflicts with StaticFiles mounted at the root path. This setting requires strict adherence to routing patterns.

**Mandatory Routing Pattern:**
- **NEVER use `"/"` as the endpoint path** in router decorators
- **ALWAYS use `""` (empty string)** for root resource endpoints
- This ensures API routes work WITHOUT trailing slashes (standard REST behavior)

**Why This Matters:**
- FastAPI combines router prefix + endpoint path to create final routes
- With `redirect_slashes=False`, routes must match exactly (no automatic redirects)
- Using `"/"` creates routes ending in `/`, requiring trailing slash in client URLs
- Using `""` creates routes without `/`, matching standard HTTP client behavior
- **This issue has occurred 3+ times** - strict adherence prevents recurrence

**Correct Patterns:**

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Root resource operations (list, create)
@router.get("")          # GET /api/v1/printers (no trailing slash)
@router.post("")         # POST /api/v1/printers (no trailing slash)

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Specific resource operations
@router.get("/{id}")     # GET /api/v1/printers/abc123
@router.put("/{id}")     # UPDATE /api/v1/printers/abc123
@router.delete("/{id}")  # DELETE /api/v1/printers/abc123

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Nested operations
@router.post("/{id}/connect")    # POST /api/v1/printers/abc123/connect
@router.get("/health")            # GET /api/v1/health
```

```python
# ‚ùå INCORRECT - Will cause 405 errors when accessed without trailing slash
@router.get("/")         # Creates route /api/v1/printers/ (WITH slash)
@router.post("/")        # Requires POST /api/v1/printers/ (WITH slash)
                         # Standard clients send without slash ‚Üí 405 ERROR
```

**Testing Requirements:**
- All API endpoints MUST be tested WITHOUT trailing slash
- Integration tests should verify POST/PUT/DELETE work without trailing slash
- Any new router must follow the empty string `""` pattern for root endpoints

**Git History Reference:**
- Previous fixes: commits ddf53ea, 34680e6, branch fix/disable-redirect-slashes
- Root cause: StaticFiles at "/" + redirect_slashes=False + "/" endpoints
- This is a permanent architectural constraint - do not attempt to re-enable redirect_slashes

## Deployment Architecture

Printernizer supports **three independent deployment methods**. Each method uses the same core codebase but has deployment-specific configurations:

### 1. Python Standalone
- **Location**: Root directory (`run.sh`, `run.bat`)
- **Use Case**: Development, testing, local installation
- **Setup**: Direct Python execution
- **Configuration**: `.env` file
- **Data Storage**: Local directories (`data/`, `printer-files/`)

### 2. Docker Standalone
- **Location**: `docker/` directory
- **Use Case**: Production servers, NAS systems
- **Setup**: `docker-compose up -d`
- **Configuration**: Environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Data Storage**: Docker volumes (persistent)
- **Files**:
  - `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build with Python 3.11
  - `docker-compose.yml` - Full orchestration
  - `entrypoint.sh` - Container initialization
  - `README.md` - Docker deployment guide

### 3. Home Assistant Add-on
- **Location**: `printernizer/` directory (Add-on name)
- **Use Case**: Home Assistant users, 24/7 integration
- **Setup**: Install via HA Add-on Store (repository.json)
- **Configuration**: HA UI (`options.json`)
- **Data Storage**: `/data/printernizer/` (HA persistent storage)
- **Files**:
  - `Dockerfile` - Alpine-based with `ARG BUILD_FROM`
  - `config.yaml` - Add-on metadata and schema
  - `build.yaml` - Multi-architecture builds
  - `run.sh` - HA-specific startup with bashio
  - `README.md` - Add-on store description
  - `DOCS.md` - Detailed user documentation
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - Add-on version history
- **Repository**: `repository.json` in root for HA Add-on Store discovery

### Deployment Mode Detection

The application automatically detects deployment mode via environment variables:
- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=standalone` - Default Python mode
- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=docker` - Docker standalone
- `DEPLOYMENT_MODE=homeassistant` - HA Add-on mode
- `HA_INGRESS=true` - Enables Ingress security (HA only)

### Shared Codebase

**IMPORTANT**: All three deployment methods share:
- `src/` - Application code (unchanged for all modes)
- `frontend/` - Web interface (unchanged for all modes)
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- Core business logic and features

**Deployment-specific**:
- Startup scripts (`run.sh` vs `entrypoint.sh` vs HA `run.sh`)
- Configuration parsing (`.env` vs env vars vs `options.json`)
- Path mapping (local vs volumes vs `/data`)
- Security (direct vs Docker vs Ingress)

## Future Enhancements
- **MQTT discovery** for Home Assistant sensors (printer status, job completion)
- **HA automations** integration with triggers and actions
- **Kubernetes deployment** for enterprise scale-out
- **Desktop GUI application** as alternative to web interface
- **Advanced 3D preview capabilities** with multiple rendering options

## Development Notes
- Focus on enterprise features while maintaining simplicity
- Consider standard business practices and configurable accounting requirements
- **Remember to increase version number** accordingly when branches get integrated into master
- **Always create a new branch** when you develop a new feature or major bugfix
- **Keep deployment methods independent** - changes should not break any deployment option
- **Test all three deployment methods** before merging to master
